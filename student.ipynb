    "Nowadays companies are beginning to realize the importance of data availability in large amounts which allows them to infer meaningful results and make informed business decisions. With development of new technologies, Internet and social networks, production of digital data is constantly growing. To get the most out of data, a robust and thorough data analysis process is needed. This project uses exploratory data analysis to generate insights from the movie industry for use by Microsoft Company.\n"
